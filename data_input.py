A very common task in a program or script is simply capturing data typed by the keyboard by a user, this data will then be processed for a particular task.

In Python, to capture data typed on the keyboard by a user, we can employ the function input() which will activate the typing mode in the console, this way the 
input() function will store a typed data type to a variable, for example. It is important to remember that we can pass a text (string) as a parameter to the input() 
function, requesting more specific data from the user.
